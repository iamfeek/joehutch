Hi. I'm Joe Hutchinson and this is my blog.

I believe AI will be the most disruptive technology the world has ever seen.  I'm both excited and terrified of the possibilities it presents.  To be a part of this revolution, and help ensure we do it safely and ethically, I'm working on a master's at NC State focusing on robotics and artificial intelligence.

In my free time I enjoy watching sci-fi films, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with friends.
